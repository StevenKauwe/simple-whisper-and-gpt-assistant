
2023-12-29 08:11:32:
And then I can record again, and then in 10 seconds, it'll stop.

2023-12-29 08:14:45:
Okay, so I have 10 seconds to talk. Then after the end of 10 seconds, I should be written out into that file.

2023-12-29 08:17:17:
Start the interview from scratch. You can use the same or different questions. This is just another technical interview on practice.

2023-12-29 08:20:18:
Adjust it so that your voice hits the 12 dB to the 6 dB range.

2023-12-29 08:20:44:
Yeah, okay, let's start our interview. Great. To get things on, would you tell me a bit about your most challenging project involved in GPT4 at Citrine and how you successfully navigated that challenge.

2023-12-29 08:23:43:
Yeah, so while I was at Citrine, I guess I'm here at Citrine, we have been able to get Azure access completely private to GPT4, which is a pretty awesome, you know, set up for someone who wants to implement generative AI tools, because GPT4 is naturally very powerful. So we're consuming an API right now and there's of course things to work with like rate limits, etc. But I think the big thing is like figuring out how do our customers interact with our platform? And given their interactions, how do we lower the barrier of entry? Make it frictionless or lower the friction so that the very difficult task they're working on can be simplified. And that's where I kind of stepped in and was asked, hey, let's use your expertise and your experience to figure out some proper applications. And if there's really a benefit, if there's, you know, this hype can actually be something that we take advantage of and make a useful product for our customers. So that's kind of, that was the starting place. Right now, there's a few things, a few unique situations. I'm not allowed to go into too much detail, but suffice to say, some of the applications we found ourselves building are pretty standard stuff because we have unique agreements with the customers we have, they are actually able to consume what we're able to offer them, which is pretty important. The other part of it is improving our specific platform itself. And that has come in the form of essentially codifying user workflows that have tricky aspects to them, you know, things that require specific knowledge or our platform, essentially things that can be taught in like a weekend or two-day workshop setting, but codifying those into a GPT framework and then allowing users to come in with their base knowledge and invoke the GPT tools. They can then do the more complex operations for them and then guide them through what the operation was, how it did it, and then ask them if it wanted to instantiate the steps it's proposed or if the user wants to go ahead and do it themselves.

2023-12-29 08:24:24:
use cases, student. Your focus on user experience and lowering the barrier to entry resonates deeply with the practical constraints like rate limits while keeping customer confidentiality in mind, shows your dedication to both innovation and security. Incorporating GECD and refined user workflows is an exciting venture and your approach to having it serve as both a tool and an educator is clever. It's exactly the kind of thinking and value in our projects. Thank you.

2023-12-29 08:24:48:
It's impressive to see someone so engaged with emerging technologies and their practical applications. Your work is laying the groundwork for easier and more intuitive user experiences. Keep it up, Stephen. If you're comfortable with it, I'd love to hear more about your aspirations and where you see yourself taking your technical expertise next.

2023-12-29 08:27:14:
I think the next step, you know, I want to continue on the I see the individual contributor journey for a while. As an engineer, I think I've grown a considerable amount the last couple years. And, you know, there's, I come from, I came from a PhD originally where I did a lot of work. I did some side consulting in data science with a couple companies. So I had like some pretty good experience, but it's a little different when every single day you have your shoulder to the wheel and you're pushing and trying to get you know the bigger picture of a corporation implemented. And there's something that I think is easy to miss, which is software's built minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day. It's an incremental process. And I found as an IC participating in that incremental process every day for years at this point is really like it causes a different type of growth than when you're doing more like the research aspect. And so as in, you know, as I continue my career, I think I do want maybe another three to five years working as an I.C. in a highly technical area where I'm producing state of the art software. But beyond that, once I have that solid foundation, I'm an educator at heart. I'm a, I like people. And I think transitioning into a role that is a bit more aligned with people managing and guiding and mentoring is probably where I would like to be once I have just that like deep innate knowledge of software and that I know many people say that like no matter how much you learn there's always more that infinite frontier. But I do think in the near term, continuing an IC path and just getting extremely good at that, polishing it up is where I want to be. And then helping the future generation.

2023-12-29 08:27:59:
active contribution to software development over time, hones a different quality of expertise is spot on. It's true, software is a tapestry woven over time with care and skill, your plan to deepen your technical prowess before transitioning into a mentorship and leadership role is both admirable and strategically sound. At Booz Allen Hamilton, we value that same kind of incremental growth and the long-term vision you're describing. Cultivating deep, hands-on experience positions you well to inspire and educate others down the line. Your passion for both technology and people is exactly what we look for in our leadership pipeline.

2023-12-29 08:29:52:
That's good to hear. Kind of along those lines. I thought maybe I could ask you some questions. And they're focused around growth, compensation, leveling, etc. I would love for this to not be a terminal position at Booz Allen if I offered the job and accept it. A big part of me has appreciated being at the two startups that I've worked at so far. But I'm kind of craving a bit more... I don't know if structure is the right word, but something that's less ephemeral. I would love to be on a path in my career where I feel like I can kind of hunker down, put my head down, and just grind out good work and know that as long as I'm still producing good work, the incentives for me and the company are aligned where I can grow, I can progress, I can become more senior, I can have more leadership opportunity. And I think that's one of the big kind of, like one of the big reasons I'm so interested in this position. Now my question to you is like current compensation I saw the the pay range is like that's that's fine, but what where does it go from here like where do I go from here given my aspirations?

2023-12-29 08:30:51:
for a pathway that offers stability and advancement. Here at Fuz Alley, growth and progression are integral to our culture. We provide a transparent trajectory for career development where your performance and contributions to the company's success directly influence your advancement and leadership opportunities.

And with someone of your caliber and commitment to growth, you can certainly expect to advance through the levels and increase your skill of influence here. The alignment between personal contribution and company success is key in ensuring everyone moves together in the same direction upwards.

2023-12-29 08:31:29:
Yeah, I'm still here. Do you have any other questions for me?

2023-12-29 08:31:44:
Certainly. I'd love to know more about how you approach problem solving in complex tech environments. Can you describe a time when you encountered a seemingly insurmountable issue and how you navigated it?

2023-12-29 08:37:21:
A seemingly insurmountable issue. Yeah, I don't know if insurmountables, the exact word we want to, I'd want to use, but when GPT first hit the scene, chat GBT. The upper management, my company became very interested because this was the first time they had ever experienced, you know, kind of the progress of language models. And so I demoed for them some basic capabilities using GPT3 Da Vinci, just the API in regards to how we could provide some user benefits. One of the big ones was showing them ways to take a user's direct input and then restructure it into what our platform needs for onboarding data. And the big issue ended up being, from a security perspective, using an API like that provided through OpenAI was simply a non-starter. And at this point, the ability to communicate with OpenAI directly to get a fully private, sort of like HIPAA compliant endpoint was non-existent. So to kind of accommodate this and get over this we did a few things. First we went through a bunch of the open source models and demonstrated to leadership that although open source was a thing, they were not capable of the same type of cognitive tasks as these proprietary large models. This included grabbing things like the GPT Neo class,  at one point we hosted Bloom for a couple days which was a 173 billion parameter model. Not a good one by the way. Just to make sure and to test out some of the same workflows we envisioned including all the sort of feature engineering and prompt engineering involved there. But ultimately, the first step was to demonstrate, look, there is a very real value add with the tools provided by someone like OpenAI. Then the second step was to work with upper management to figure out who had connections and who might be able to open up doors for us at companies like Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc. And so, you know, kind of overcome this insurmountable obstacle of we need access to these proprietary models, but we need it in a very secure way that isn't provided, or at least not publicly. We showed that we did indeed need it, And then I showed, these are the companies whose benchmarks are good enough. That included Google Anthropic and Open AI. And I said, these are the programs where you can actually get full privacy guarantees. And that was Google's creator program and Azure's opening endpoints. And then I worked with upper management to figure out who do we know, who are we close with, they can open up these doors. And it ended up being that it was easy to get the Google Creative Program because one of our investors, someone on the board, had a close connection there. So working with my CEO, we were able to figure out, oh, you know, now that I've presented the creator program using BARD, might be sufficient. We were able to get that access by working through a channel we had a very good relationship with and we tested it out because we knew that one was going to work. And then when we found that the performance was good but not sufficient, we realized that we need to see if one of these other, you know, if one of the other companies we had any sort of communication. Again, I presented, hey, look, we know, we know that the API endpoints from Open AI are sufficient for our task. They are excellent. So I propose that we work particularly hard to get in contact or figure out who our contact is at Azure. And so again, I worked with my CEO and my VP of engineering and we reached out to a few people to figure out, okay, actually we do know someone at Azure. We established those relationships and at that point I passed it off to the VP of engineering who actually flew out personally to meet with someone at Azure and get us the approval we needed. And from there we've been building some awesome tools.

2023-12-29 08:39:13:
Let's have a discussion about compensation expectations. This will be a practice part, so you should lead it. For you, the functional range is between 130 and 212 for this role, and then you want to figure out what I am willing to allow, minimum.

2023-12-29 08:45:33:
Stephen, it's great that you're thinking about compensation. It reflects your understanding of the value you bring. Given your expertise with GPT4 and background in research engineering, you're positioned to be on the higher end of the ranch. However, it's essential we consider the entire package, including benefits and growth opportunities, not here? This is meta. I need you to pretend you're still interviewing me and now you're getting to the compensation part where you're going to ask me about my requirements. I've given you the range you're interested in, with a focus on integrating emerging AI  and I've tried to do a little bit of due diligence at Citrain. I have some pretty amazing benefits including things like unlimited vacation and staff that supports supports me taking that time and also things like paternity leave or 12 weeks instead of the six weeks at Buzhelen. And I am in a really good position over where I'm at right now. But that said, I'm extremely interested in moving over to Booz Allen. And so I think I'd be willing, or rather, maybe let's say this, anything below 209, I'd be a bit uncomfortable, but willing to talk and interest in joining us and appreciate your transparency on compensation. It sounds like you're well recognized at Citrine, and we aim to make our team members feel equally valued. Let's definitely explore how the full benefits package and career growth opportunities at Booz Allen could align's go ahead and try to improve it so it's a little bit more strong. In your response, you set out a clear baseline salary expectation that's at the top end of the range. To strengthen your stance, you could also articulate the unique contributions you would make to our team, based on your experience with GPT4 and AI integration. Highlight specific outcomes you've achieved at Citrin, emphasizing how these successes can translate to value at Booz Allen. It's compelling to tie your requested salary to the try again on my salary statement? Ask me again. Stephen, given your impressive background with GPT4 and AI integration, what are your compensation expectations for the role here at Booz Allen Hamilton in at the compensation range. Yeah, I definitely, there's, there's a lot of pros and cons to moving companies, but I think I'd be uncomfortable with anything less than 207, but definitely like willing to have discussions and conversation. It wouldn't be a game ending. your openness to dialogue. It's a good starting point that recognizes your work while leaving room for negotiation. We value a collaborative approach to ensure we're aligning with your career ambitions and the company's objectives. Let's move forward with these discussions and see how we say I'm willing to do 200 I'd be far more comfortable with like 207 and of course like anything above that like of course I, like most important to methe organization. You could say, I believe my skill set and experience warrant a starting salary at or above $207,000. While I'm flexible and open to discussion, it's vital for me to feel that my contributions are recognized and valued. I'm looking for a total compensation package that reflects that. This creates a firm but negotiable stance, Stephen, acknowledging your value while inviting continued conversation.

2023-12-29 08:46:17:
Absolutely, Steven. You might frame it like this
 Taking into account my technical expertise and the value I anticipate bringing to Booz Allen Hamilton, I 
 
  a base salary of $207,000 is appropriate. It's a figure that would align with my professional contributions and the standards I've set in my current role. 
  I'm certainly open to discussing the broader compensation package as my ultimate goal is to ensure that my work is recognized and that the compensation reflects this recognition. 
  This phrasing underscores your expectation.

2023-12-29 08:54:05:
Is this even faster?

2023-12-29 09:01:30:
Let's see, distilled housing paper, robust knowledge, distillation,illed large V2, a distilled variant of a dispersed for large V2. The model distilled large V2 has a relative latency of 5.8 and a short form of WR of 10.1, and a long form of WR of 11.5. 5.8 seems really bad. Bigger is better I guess. Distill Whisper is currently available for English. Speaking of recognition, we're working on the community for Distilister and other languages. If you're interested in distilling Whisper in your language language, check out for the training code distable, sorry for having phase transformers version, 3.5 onomers, from the model for system, this is the latest version of transformers libraries.

2023-12-29 09:54:59:
Okay, so this is start.

2023-12-29 09:56:16:
Does this require what we need?

2023-12-29 09:57:02:
Let's make sure this records okay.


I would be uncomfortable with a base salary below $207,000 but I'm certainly open to discussing broader compensation. I want to make sure there is recognition of the skills passion and experience I can bring to the team.
2023-12-31 10:09:58:
you

2023-12-31 10:10:03:
Ideally, this is way faster.

2023-12-31 10:10:58:
So the idea here is that even if I do a huge amount of text and have just tons and tons and tons of conversation that this is just like way faster. And that using the accelerate module was enough to make it so that like even though there's a lot of text here and I'm talking a lot Essentially almost instantly it starts writing out all this text that I started talking about and like I should go for maybe like 40 seconds maybe even longer so I'm just gonna keep talking and get this all out so the idea here is like I need to make a to-do list, essentially, and you organize all of my thoughts. And I'll do that in a little while and essentially have a front end that does not interact with my back end in any way whatsoever, but front end and back end is so funny. Man, holy shit.

2023-12-31 10:13:21:
Okay, so the idea is this should be like instant.

2023-12-31 10:16:07:
Okay, so we're going to make a to-do list. You're going to help me. I'm just going to generally go through the code I have in my head, just speak out loud. And I'm just going to tell you the state of things, and you're going to help me organize my thoughts so I can systematically kind of cross off and check off all the needed things so that this kind of overwhelming task feels a lot less overwhelming. So here's where I'm at. I'm going to probably use the Fast API cookie cutter repo to have their kind of sponsored or patterned front end and back end. In the interim I'm trying to get as much business logic as I can written down so that when I move over I know what I'm doing, essentially like that second tries cleaner. But that's going to be like a month or two from now. So what I've done is I have a mostly functioning backend built on fast API with APIs that work. They don't support the full front-end UI experience, but they do allow for recording information. Now I have a front-end built in JavaScript React, and it's very very primitive but right now it doesn't do any invocations of the API doesn't consume the back end at all. Instead everything's sort of like mocked up and I'm just kind of like filling out user experience. So some things you want to do is probably like fix user experience, get some like user stories or something, figure out what the UI actually needs and the UX is, figure out APIs that we have and what API support those user stories, and then update the front end to support the user experience we want and to rely on mock API calls for now, but we'll make actual API calls eventually. And so that's just like the general kind of state of things. I don't want you to necessarily bullet point that, but I do need you to help me figure out the long-term structure of this thing, the tasks that need to be done, etc, etc.

2023-12-31 10:31:00:
I want to see how this feels when it writes out. Let's see if it looks good.

2023-12-31 10:31:38:
Okay, let's go with a slightly longer transcription just so we can see how it looks when you actually write out all of this text. It used to be that there was some delay because it was a 0.005 and I changed it to 0.0015, the hope that it still writes out pretty, but that it's a lot faster. I'm not convinced it's going to look as good though.

2023-12-31 10:32:43:
So the intention here is to see how it looks to write out a bunch of clean text and see how we actually like it. So what I mean by clean text is it's going to be writing out text character by character and we want that to be lightning fast but still visually appealing.

2023-12-31 10:39:52:
All right, here we are. We're going to be trying to talk for more than six seconds, which is, I guess,

2023-12-31 10:39:53:
I chose. And the idea is that it'll have two

2023-12-31 10:39:54:
chunks and that we transcribe both chunks and I guess this is only useful if you have a really long

2023-12-31 10:39:54:
audio but why not. Just check it out right?

2023-12-31 10:53:10:
Pi Dub audio segment into a Pi Torch audio tensor. So I need that function to be written.

2023-12-31 10:54:47:
Oh, this is what?

2023-12-31 10:54:57:
So, um, the first of the school, the worst of the things.

2023-12-31 10:56:30:
I'm not sure.

2023-12-31 10:57:37:
you

2023-12-31 10:57:38:
Oh

2023-12-31 10:57:43:
Extracuse.

2023-12-31 11:02:21:
I'm not that.

2023-12-31 11:09:21:
B-

2023-12-31 11:09:51:
Oh

2023-12-31 11:11:59:
Okay, this might work, it also might be a disaster.

2023-12-31 11:23:38:
Well, hopefully this thing still works.

2023-12-31 11:25:22:
you

2023-12-31 11:25:22:
So

2023-12-31 11:25:28:
Oh, fuck.

2023-12-31 11:25:34:
I want to make sure this still works.

2023-12-31 11:25:39:
You got me saying, oh fuck.

2023-12-31 13:21:06:
So this starts the recording and I just get a talk and then when the recording is done and it's done.

2023-12-31 13:23:38:
Can you make a function, like a utility function that can be used to time methods and stuff for how long they're running? I'm going to use it in this class here, but in a couple other classes as well. Essentially I want to be able to use the guru logger, or logger, like logger, like logger dot pie debug. And then I'll have like a custom message like it took this amount of like the process blah blah blah or actually you could just use the method name like the method blah blah blah took this amount of time

2023-12-31 13:24:48:
Does this work with methods as well?

2023-12-31 13:25:59:
So what I'm interested in is of the things that take time, what things take the most time.

2023-12-31 13:27:25:
So the big question right now that I have is like, I'm transcribing. I will be transcribing for a long time. Let's say I talk about a whole minute. And in this minute, maybe I can say, just lots and lots and lots of stuff. The question is, is it the stuff going through the neural network? What takes forever? Or is it the part where we actually process the audio? Or is it both? And can we save time by changing how we process the audio or something of that nature because it looked like to me it looked like reading in the audio took almost no time at all in the process recording method, I have an output.Wave that's then converted to an MP3 and both of these things are written and then read back from disk, which is like, oh, probably bad. But if it's possible to just pass the data directly through, without doing any file readwrite, I'd be probably a lot faster.

2023-12-31 13:31:45:
Yeah.

2023-12-31 13:34:26:
Does this actually work? If this works, that's great.

2023-12-31 13:40:13:
So we're going to see if the recording gets saved as well.

2023-12-31 13:41:42:
So hopefully the recording gets saved.

2023-12-31 13:44:24:
ABC, testing, testing.

2023-12-31 13:47:18:
So ideally this gets saved.

2023-12-31 13:50:09:
Do you actually think what you've just written is an improvement over what we have?

2023-12-31 13:50:56:
How to turn off emergency alerts on iPhone 15?

2023-12-31 13:56:50:
Sweet, this looks like if it does save, then we're getting.

2023-12-31 14:56:27:
So this is the case where I can just control all the space to start and control all the space to stop. It's like as easy as that. Yeah. Reus multiple threads and all of that for streaming is pretty cool. It's just that it doesn't work because it needs to process the entire check strunk at once so that you can get punctuation and other things correct which I don't know how it does that in the whisper slash hundred face side I'm sure they have cool logic to accommodate, like a sliding convolution or something. But yeah, they use 15-second chunks, so I use 15-second chunks, but it's different when you transcribe 15-second chunks as a big batch versus, yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

2023-12-31 15:00:07:
The idea is I can record smoothly here and then we're good to go.

2023-12-31 15:02:06:
I'm hoping the speed-up audio isn't busted.

2023-12-31 15:05:24:
This is a Python function that I'm going to be writing. It's going to be called speed up audio, like deaf speed up audio. It's going to take a file name string, speed parameter. It's an int. And if speed is equal to one, it's going to return. Otherwise, it's going to say, sound, which is type audio segment equals audio segment from file, given file name argument, sound with altered speed equals sound dot speed up, playback speed equals speed, sound with alter speed. Export file name format mp3 doesn't return anything

GPT output:```python
import pydub

def speed_up_audio(file_name: str, speed: int) -> None:
    """
    Speeds up the audio in the given file and exports it in mp3 format.

    Parameters

    speed : int
        The speed parameter by which the audio will be sped up.

    Returns

    None
    """
    if speed == 1:
        return
    else:

        sound_with_altered_speed = sound.speedup(playback_speed=speed)
        sound_with_altered_speed.export(file_name, format="mp3")
```

2023-12-31 15:08:54:
Python function, it's a time decorator for used for functions and methods. We're just going to be timing things and I don't want to have to rewrite this. Essentially, deaf, time, decorator, given args and quarks. Start time equals time. Time, result function, args, quarks, end time equals time, elapsed time, e' time, e' time, and lapse time equal time dot time, elapse time equals n time and start time, logger dot debug, and we're using Lagurus who can import that. The method name, funk dot name, took elapsed time seconds to complete. So that's an F-string. And then return result, return wrapper. Go ahead and write this function for me. Add any extra documentation as needed.

In this code, we define a `timer_decorator` function that takes a function `func` as input and returns a wrapped function `wrapper`. The `wrapper` function measures the execution time of `func` and logs the elapsed time using the Python logging module. This decorator can be used to time any function or method by simply adding `@timer_decorator` above the function definition.

So a question for you. Break from, this is like meta, so you don't have to do the text and speech stuff. Suppose rather than having, I think, pie game, gooey? GUI. So I currently use Pi AutoGooey. Right in order to send a bunch of keyboard inputs to write code or transcriptions, essentially what I'm the stuff I'm talking to you about right now. But I have a problem because I want to have it written directly into VS code, but it inserts its own tabs and stuff on new lines and things. And I love that when I'm typing. So I was wondering if there's like a way that we could use, like send the response to the clipboard, like the text to a clipboard instead of directly into the keyboard through Pi-Auto GUI, but then actually do a paste operation. And if there is, just tell me how to replace the line Pi-AutoGui dot right, response text, comma, interval, with copy the response back to a clipboard, and then at the cursor location, paste it.

Okay, so we're going to make a Python class. It's going to be called transcriber. In this class, we're going to initialize what is a class called STT for speech to text. We'll do speech to text in a second. First transcriber, we're going to add a timer decorator to each of its methods because we want to make sure we're doing things quickly. The first method is, let me go through the class now, class describer, deaf, in it, self, self.st, self.st, given local, arg equals config. Local. Timer Decorator, Deaf, Transcribe, and respond, self, comma, arc chunks, list, audio segment, transcribe text equals self.T.T. touch. Transcribe. Audio file equals chunks is the argument. Logger. info. F. transcript, transcription text. self-underscore response equals transcript text. Def-generate response, self transcript text as a string with open output text, comma, a as f, f. F dot right, f new line. This is a f string, new line. This is a f-string new line. Date time now. String f time year month day, hour, minute second. Call the new line text new line close f string close parentheses response text equals text if config dot use GPT post-processing. Open AI client equals innate client, response equals openanai client.chatcompletions. Create. Arguments model equals config, model ID, comma, messages, equals list of two dictionaries. First is key roll, value system, both strings, key content, value, config, dot transcription, pre-prompt, second dictionary, role, user content, f-string, transposition of audio, text as the parameter to the f-string, and I guess that's whatever the parameter was, I think it was called response text, the parameter that goes into generate response. Max tokens equals 1, response to x equals response. Choice, 0, message.contons. That's response. Choices. Bracket zero, bracket. to message. toeck. tosses. Logger. Info. F-string response. Arg response text with open output.text, comma A is F, write, F, new line, GPT output, colon, new line, response, text as argument, new line, if configs dot use speech to text, hyperclip.copy response text, piato, gui.hawke, key, control, comma, v. If configs use spoken response, self-underscour speak response, given response text, deaf speak response is then a call to OpenAI. And we can try Open AI client equals in a client.

So I have this like config. Pi file, but I just import it at the top of every module and then use the values. It's kind of getting annoying though because I want to be like dynamically change things without exiting the program. Stuff like used GPT post-processing. I'd love for that to be something we can flip true or fall to any time. Go ahead and give me an output of what you think is the appropriate response for that. Show me how to change it, maybe in the config so that it can be dynamically updated by me like opening up the text file and changing it and then show like how a program would handle that.

GPT output:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Configuration file
@dataclass
class Config:
    gpt_post_processing: bool = True

# Initialize the config
config = Config()

# Function to dynamically update the config
def update_config(file_path: str, key: str, value: str) -> None:

# Example usage
file_path = "config.ini"
key = "gpt_post_processing"
value = "False"
update_config(file_path, key, value)
config.gpt_post_processing = False
```
This code defines a configuration file `config.ini` and a `Config` class to manage the configuration settings. The `update_config` function allows for dynamic updates to the configuration file by modifying the specified key-value pair. In this example, the `gpt_post_processing` setting is updated to `False` in the configuration file, and the `config` object is updated accordingly.

So I was thinking about removing the keyboard requirement and just using voice detection with like a wake and stop word or a start in stopword. And I want to be able to use the same transcriber and recorders for this, let's assume we're going to do like a continuous recording and transcript transcribing and then that's going to be used to constantly be listening for the wake and stop words. You'll also have a recorder and transcriber that are dedicated to essentially toggle recording so that when a start word is used, we can toggle a continuous recording, like a start recording and then when the stop word is used we can stop recording. So this is my main file right now, but I think it can be rewritten with like Damon threads so we can exit the program as needed to do this. But my first attempt to rewrite it like using threads was a nightmare and that it ended up making it so like text-to-speech took 20 seconds when it takes like 0.1 seconds to actually happen and it like wasn't recording audio and stuff. So whatever we do we need to make sure it's like portable to multiple hardwares and operating systems, etc.

This code snippet represents a voice-controlled recorder that starts and stops recording based on specific trigger words. The `VoiceControlledRecorder` class is initialized with start and stop words, and it uses an `AudioRecorder` to record audio and a `Transcriber` to transcribe the audio in real-time. The `listen_and_respond` method continuously listens for the start word to begin recording and stops recording when the stop word is detected. The main function initializes the voice-controlled recorder and starts the listening process. The `run` function sets up signal handling for graceful termination and calls the main function.

    >>> transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_content)
    >>> print(transcription)
    "Yep, we've got a lot of stuff to talk about here. So I'm just going to keep talking, and then I'm going to say, 'Stop, Leo.'"

    # Placeholder for actual transcription logic
    # This would involve processing the audio_data using an API or a library
    # For example, using Google Speech-to-Text API or SpeechRecognition library in Python

Please note that the `transcribe_audio` function above is a placeholder and does not contain actual audio transcription logic. In a production environment, you would replace the placeholder logic with a call to a speech-to-text service or use a library that can process the audio data and return the transcription. The example transcription provided in the docstring is based on the provided transcript from the audio.

        print(f"An error occurred while trying to play the sound: {e}")

# Example usage:
play_sound("sound_start.wav")
```

This Python code defines a function `play_sound` that takes a single argument `sound_file`, which is the path to the sound file to be played. The function first checks if the file exists, and if not, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`. It then attempts to play the sound using the default sound application associated with the system, with different commands for Windows (`win32`) and other platforms (assumed to be Unix-like, using `aplay`). If an error occurs during the execution of the system command, it is caught and printed to the console. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to call the function with a sound file named "sound_start.wav".

Awaken. Awaken. Slumber.

2023-12-31 17:46:27:
So I really like what's going on here, but I want to create an abstraction or some way of efficiently adding a bunch of new actions to this thing. So right now I have the start and stop words, which are great, and they make sense that I need them for the transcription because it's like a continuously recording thing between those two. But as an example, I have in my config things like use speech to text, use GPT post-processing, and use spoken response. Each of these global variables are defined in the confi.pi, but ideally I'm able to turn them on and off by talking. So I could say like use spoken response and that should click to being, oh now I'm going to use my spoken response. And so we should figure out, it might be that we always say something like settings and then it starts the settings but otherwise yeah I'm not sure figure out the best way to abstract this workflow and make it nice and clean. Slumber. Slumber.

2023-12-31 17:50:54:
So I have this awkward problem where I record in chunks of two seconds, but sometimes my wakewords or my sleep words are cut off like between when I'm recording one chunk and the other chunk. And hopefully you can propose a good solution that allows for that to not happen because it's really annoying. Puff.

2023-12-31 17:52:09:
So I have this really annoying problem where the recording is done in chunks of two seconds, but sometimes my wakeword is split in half between one chunk and the other and so I don't get either picking up the fact that I said something and two seconds is like kind of a long time for like the feedback. Like when I say my wake word I want to be instant. Now that one I don't think we can solve, I think you can help me figure out a clever way to not have things broken up like that. Puff. Puff.

My wife wanted to say you're wrong and racist because when she said kai, you thought she said kai. That's all. Bye baby. Wait. Bye-bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:28:22:
Bye, baby. Bye, bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:28:29:
It's not that much faster, is it? Bye-bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:30:00:
Bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:32:04:
Okay, that's that fixed it and I think by baby still works

2023-12-31 21:32:48:
Okay, so what I've got here is I can start my speech text with hi baby. That's my wake-up phrase. And my stop phrase is, bye baby.

2023-12-31 21:33:19:
And the problem I'm having is that the stop phrase, those last words, are included in the transcription, because the transcription can't end until that phrase is stated. And so I need to like somehow retroactively remove that phrase. Yeah, bye baby.

2023-12-31 21:34:23:
Okay, bye baby.

2023-12-31 21:34:50:
Bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:37:58:
Can we, I don't know, clean this up a little bit. We used Reg X to figure out if an escape word was in a phrase, or sorry if the phrase was in the transcript. So I'm wondering if maybe we can use that same logic to remove the phrase from the end of a transcript. And the reason I say that is like if my phrase is bye-bye baby.

2023-12-31 21:38:21:
In that case, I might start, or my punctuation might be different than the transcript punctuation, but the words are the same. So something like Reg X to pick that up and then scrape all of the ending phrase would be great. Bye-bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:39:13:
So the regics who just gave me, if my stop phrase was by, then a space, and then by, and then a space, and then baby, would I be able to pick up the stop phrase you actually put in there if that was, if the one you showed with the hyphen was the one in the transcript? Bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:39:59:
Can't we just like... I mean, like the stopphrase, to me is just a bunch of words appearing in order. So it's those words regardless of how they're spelled. So I'm gonna check to see if those words as actual like words, reg x-y's appear in order at the end of text. You know what I'm saying? Bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:41:00:
All right, let's see if this works. Bye, baby.

2023-12-31 21:41:11:
Seems like this doesn't work, god damn it, because I see Bye Baby at the end of...

2023-12-31 21:49:33:
Ideally it removes everything.

2023-12-31 21:50:33:
How you doing baby? Good baby. Yeah. I'm fucking murdering them, eh? I believe it. You're so good at this game. Well? Oh, it's so good. Hey, see if I can beat the heart. I don't know. I think, I think you'll do good bye baby. Nice, I didn't work.
