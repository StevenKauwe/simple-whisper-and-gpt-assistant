# GPT RESPONSE

Hey team :wave:,

Ran into a bit of a snag with our multi-tenant backend setup and need some input on how we handle tenant data when they leave the platform. Here's the sitch:

- Our system is built on **PostgreSQL schemas** for each tenant.
- Tenant creds are tucked away in **AWS Secrets Manager**.
- Each tenant's files chill in their own **S3 bucket**.

Now, when a tenant waves goodbye :wave:, we've got a couple of things to figure out:

1. **Buckets & Secrets**: They don't vanish instantly when we hit delete. :hourglass_flowing_sand:
2. **Asset Creation**: Buckets are born via **Terraform** and secrets come to life through **Boto3**.
3. **Immediate vs. Delayed Deletion**: Should we nix the secrets and PostgreSQL schema right away, or...
4. **Soft Delete Option**: Maybe just delete the schema user so the tables become an admin-only party? :lock:

A few more things to chew on:
- **Data Retention Policies**: How long should we hold onto the data before we delete it for good?
- **Backup Considerations**: Should we snag a backup before wiping anything, just in case?
- **Compliance & Legal**: Are there any regulations we need to keep in mind before we start the purge?
- **Notification Process**: How do we inform the tenant of the deletion process and their data rights?

Drop your thoughts below! :thought_balloon: Let's figure out the smoothest way to handle this.

Cheers,
