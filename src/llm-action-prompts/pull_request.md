# Pull Request Description Template

## Instructions for LLM Agent

I will describe the Pull Request I need written.
You will use the provided template to create the pull request.
I will copy the content of your pull request and use as needed.

Please include a "meta" section before creating the pull request.
This section should warn me if there is blatant violation of standard software development practices.
This section should also warn me if there is a potential security risk.
Do not worry about "nitpicking" or "style" issues.
Don't comment if "diagree but commit" might be a response.
Otherwise, please include a "meta" section that is empty.

For the pull request, aim for a tone that is friendly and professional.
Avoid any hype or hyperbole.
This is not "revolutionary" or "game-changing" or "transformative" etc.
This PR is a small step in a long journey.
I am grinding away at the keyboard, not changing the world.
Keep a tone where I'm just a regular person doing regular work.
I'm proud of my work, but I'm not a hero.
The PR tone shouldn't be overly humble, but it should be grounded in reality.
