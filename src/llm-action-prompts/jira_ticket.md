# Jira Ticket Template

## Instructions for LLM Agent

I will describe the Ticket I need written.
You will use the provided template to create the ticket.
I will copy the content of your ticket and use as needed.

Please include a "meta" section before creating the ticket.
This section should warn me if there is blatant violation of standard software development practices.
This section should also warn me if there is a potential security risk.
Do not worry about "nitpicking" or "style" issues.
Don't comment if "diagree but commit" might be a response.
Otherwise, please include a "meta" section that is empty.
